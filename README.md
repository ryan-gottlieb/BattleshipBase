# BattleshipBase
Python-coded Battleship Game
The base of the battleship has been coded, given X amount of shots to sink all randomly generated ships.
There are four modes integrated in the game, and this can be used as a template to create a two-player version of the game or a more advanced player vs AI mode.
Lastly the debug mode is currently turned on which allows the user to test the code by seeing exactly where the ships are placed. 
If set to false the ship locations "S" will be turned into "U" or unkowns.
